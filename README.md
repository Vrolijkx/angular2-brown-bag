# Pre requirements
- have node and npm installed
- have a terminal
- have a good text editor. I use webstorm but (VS CODE https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/code-vs.aspx) has also great typescript support.


## Running the examples
For running the first examples I use the local ```httpster``` server. You can install it with ```npm install httpster -g```.
To use it go to the required folder in your terminal and start a local server with ```httpster```
