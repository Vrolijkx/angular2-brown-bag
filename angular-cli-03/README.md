# This an angular-cli generated project

AngularCli does some scafolding for you. But if you need some specific configuration you still need to get in SystemJs config.

# Setup

run the following:

- ```npm install angular-cli -g```
- ```ng new angular-cli-03``` (angular-cli does not support names that start with numbers).

# Run the project in watch mode

Run ```npm start``` or ```ng serve```

(tip for webstorm/intellJ users exclude the tmp folder for better performance)
